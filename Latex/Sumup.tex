Pricing efficiently options is a difficult task. The Black-Scholes-Merton model is the most admit model to determine the price of an asset. It suppose that this price follow a Differential Stocastic Equation. Then, we have to make a simulation of the path of the asset to determine the price of the option. So, in this part we will study two methods that permite to simulate the path of the asset.
\newline
First, we will present the Euler method. It is the oldest and the simplest one. It is a fast way to estimate the path. But it's only an estimation that create a bias. And this bias cold be significant. And as a result the price will be wrong.
\newline
Then, we will present the word of Beskos \textit{et al.}. In this recent method, presented in 2006, we have several mathematic transformations. So it is a more complicated method and it longer to compute. But we get an \underline{unbiased simulated path}.
\newline
And finally, we will compute this method and compare results.
