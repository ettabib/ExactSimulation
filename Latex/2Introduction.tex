\quad The application of diffusion models are ubiquitous in several areas, including
finance, physics, biology  and engineering. In many cases the  evolution of some
phenomenons are described by a stochastic process $X=\{X_t,0<t<T\}$, determined as
the solution of a stochastic differential equation of the type :


\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:1}
\left
  \begin{cases}
      dX_t = b(X_t)dt+\sigma(X_t)dW_t \\
      X_0=x \in \mathbb{R}, ~ t \in [0,T]
  \end{cases}
\right
\end{equation}

Except for  the case  of the  black school  model, we  generally don't  know the
solution  of  this   equations,  althougt  the  simulation  of   a  solution  is
fondamental.\\
The  numerical methods  provide  us an  approximation of  the  solution. We  can
therefore compute  in practice  a quite satisfaing  solutions. Indeed  the Euler
scheme is,  for this  purpose, very usefull.  Unfotunately, this  method suffers
from  some limitations,  in the  way that  it introduce  2 types  of errors  (cf
\ref{error-euler}).\\
Recently  (2005-2006)  \cite{Beskos-Simu-exact},  Beskos  has  presented,  a  new
algorithme to compute a solution for some diffusion process, specially in the black
school case. \\

The purpose of this project is to present this new algorithme.
